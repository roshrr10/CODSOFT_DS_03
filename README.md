<h1>IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION</h1>
AIM: To train a Random Forest classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). Evaluate the performance of the trained model. Visualize various aspects of the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between features and the distribution of data points.
